### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Leoujo/leoujo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on El Quarto.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redux, TypeScript and Node.js for backend purpose.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that can help people in some way.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: contatoleoujo@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge anime fan.
